## VISION

Hazard is a powerful developer-first chat application. It competes directly with Linear, Vercel, GitHub, and Slack. Built for developers who have taste — fast, opinionated, and beautiful. Every decision should feel like it was made by a world-class design team.

**Developer:** Kim (learning, needs step-by-step explanation)  
**Assistant:** Claude (explains everything, one file at a time, no assumptions)  
**Rule:** One file, fully understood, before moving to the next.

## DESIGN SYSTEM

### Colors
```
Background:       zinc-950  (#09090b)
Surface:          zinc-900  (#18181b)
Surface elevated: zinc-800  (#27272a)
Border:           zinc-700  (#3f3f46)
Primary accent:   violet-500 (#8b5cf6)
AI gradient:      violet-500 → cyan-400
Success:          emerald-500
Error:            red-500
Warning:          amber-500
Text primary:     zinc-50
Text muted:       zinc-400
Diff add:         emerald-950 bg · emerald-400 text
Diff remove:      red-950 bg · red-400 text
```

### Typography
- UI: TBD — not Inter, something with character
- Code: JetBrains Mono

### Design References
- Sidebar density: Linear
- Surface + elevation: Vercel Dashboard
- Code blocks: GitHub + Ray.so
- Command menu: Linear Cmd+K
- AI feel: Vercel v0 / ChatGPT

### Principles
- Borders whisper, never shout (1px, zinc-800)
- Depth through layering, never heavy shadows
- Color carries meaning: violet=primary/AI, emerald=success, red=error, amber=warning
- Spacing: strict 4px base scale
- Every element: default → hover → active states, all designed

### Auth Flow
- Supabase Auth (email, no confirmation in dev)
- Database trigger auto-creates profile on signup
- Route protection via `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16)
- Session managed via cookies (server + browser clients)

### Real-time Strategy
- Supabase Realtime enabled on messages table
- Client subscribes to INSERT events filtered by channel_id
- Initial messages fetched server-side, passed as props
- New messages appended to state via Realtime subscription

### RLS Policies (Current — open for dev, tighten before ship)
- profiles: select own, update own
- workspaces: all authenticated users (open)
- workspace_members: all authenticated users (open)
- channels: all authenticated users (open)
- channel_members: all authenticated users (open)
- messages: select/insert all, update/delete own

---

## DATABASE SCHEMA (DONE ✓)

### Tables
- `profiles` — extends Supabase auth.users (trigger auto-creates on signup)
- `workspaces` — top level organization unit
- `workspace_members` — users ↔ workspaces (roles: owner, admin, member)
- `channels` — belongs to workspace (public/private)
- `channel_members` — users ↔ channels
- `messages` — belongs to channel, real-time enabled
- `threads` — belongs to a parent message
- `reactions` — belongs to message, belongs to user
- `files` — uploaded files/images, linked to messages

---
