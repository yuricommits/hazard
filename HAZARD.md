## VISION

Hazard is a powerful developer-first chat application. It competes directly with Linear, Vercel, GitHub, and Slack. Built for developers who have taste — fast, opinionated, and beautiful. Every decision should feel like it was made by a world-class design team.

**Developer:** Kim (learning, needs step-by-step explanation)  
**Assistant:** Claude (explains everything, one file at a time, no assumptions)  
**Rule:** One file, fully understood, before moving to the next.

## TECH STACK (LOCKED)

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15** — App Router, Server Components, Server Actions
- **TypeScript** — strict mode, non-negotiable
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui** — component primitives, fully owned
- **Framer Motion** — micro-interactions and animations
- **JetBrains Mono** — font for all code rendering

### Backend & Infrastructure
- **Supabase** — entire backend:
  - PostgreSQL (primary database)
  - Auth (authentication + session management)
  - Realtime (live messages, presence, typing indicators)
  - Storage (file and image uploads)
- **Upstash Redis** — rate limiting and caching
- **Cloudflare R2** — CDN for media uploads

### AI
- **Vercel AI SDK** — streaming, model switching, tool calling
- **Anthropic Claude API** — Hazard AI brain

### Developer Experience
- **Zod** — schema validation (forms → API → database)
- **Zustand** — lightweight client state
- **React Hook Form** — form handling
- **nuqs** — URL state (filters, search, threads)

### Code Quality
- **ESLint + Prettier** — consistent code style
- **Husky** — pre-commit hooks
- **Commitlint** — conventional commits

### Deployment
- **Vercel** — frontend + edge functions
- **Supabase Cloud** — managed backend

## DESIGN SYSTEM

### Colors
```
Background:       zinc-950  (#09090b)
Surface:          zinc-900  (#18181b)
Surface elevated: zinc-800  (#27272a)
Border:           zinc-700  (#3f3f46)
Primary accent:   violet-500 (#8b5cf6)
AI gradient:      violet-500 → cyan-400
Success:          emerald-500
Error:            red-500
Warning:          amber-500
Text primary:     zinc-50
Text muted:       zinc-400
Diff add:         emerald-950 bg · emerald-400 text
Diff remove:      red-950 bg · red-400 text
```

### Typography
- UI: Next.js font (TBD — not Inter, something with character)
- Code: JetBrains Mono

### Design References
- Sidebar density: Linear
- Surface + elevation: Vercel Dashboard
- Code blocks: GitHub + Ray.so
- Command menu: Linear Cmd+K
- AI feel: Vercel v0 / ChatGPT

### Principles
- Borders whisper, never shout (1px, zinc-800)
- Depth through layering, never heavy shadows
- Color carries meaning: violet=primary/AI, emerald=success, red=error, amber=warning
- Spacing: strict 4px base scale
- Every element: default → hover → active states, all designed

## ARCHITECTURE

### Data Hierarchy
```
Workspaces → Channels → Messages → Threads → Replies
```
Avoids flat message table. Scales cleanly.

### Layout
```
[Left Sidebar 240px] [Middle Panel flex-1] [Right Sidebar 280px collapsible]
```

### Auth Flow
- Supabase Auth (email + OAuth)
- Session managed server-side via Next.js middleware
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all Supabase tables

### Real-time Strategy
- Supabase Realtime for messages, presence, typing indicators
- Optimistic UI everywhere — app feels faster than it is

### File Uploads
- Cloudflare R2 via presigned URLs
- Supabase Storage as fallback
- Never upload through the main server

### Rate Limiting
- Upstash Redis on API routes
- Protect against automated scripts

### Security
- E2EE consideration for private channels (future)
- RLS policies on every table
- API keys never stored in messages (scrubbed or warned)

## DATABASE SCHEMA (PLANNED — NOT BUILT YET)

### Tables
- `profiles` — extends Supabase auth.users
- `workspaces` — top level organization unit
- `workspace_members` — users ↔ workspaces (roles: owner, admin, member)
- `channels` — belongs to workspace (public/private)
- `channel_members` — users ↔ channels
- `messages` — belongs to channel, optionally belongs to thread
- `threads` — belongs to a parent message
- `reactions` — belongs to message, belongs to user
- `files` — uploaded files/images, linked to messages

---

## OPEN QUESTIONS

- Font choice for UI (not Inter — something with more character)
- Upstash Redis free tier enough for early stage?
- Cloudflare R2 vs Supabase Storage to start with?
- shadcn/ui theme customization approach
